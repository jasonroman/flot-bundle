Jason Roman's Flot Bundle
==============

This is my Flot bundle.  The bundle contains the following components:

# Flot Charting Class

This is a class that transforms PHP arrays of series data into a JSON format that Flot can understand.  It supports line/bar charts, pie charts, horizontal/vertical orientation, and time series data.  It also supports single or multiple series.

See the comments in the class for examples of the various forms of array $data that can be passed to the convert() function.
